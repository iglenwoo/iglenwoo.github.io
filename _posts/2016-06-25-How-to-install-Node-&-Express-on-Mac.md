title: How to install Node & Express on Mac
---

I am going to use [brew](http://brew.sh) in this section.
It is super convenient and powerful to install Tools on Mac OS.

1. update brew first.

```Shell
brew update
```


2. install Node

```Shell
brew install node
```


3. Install Express

*-g* or *--global* argument will cause npm to install the package globally rather than locally. 

```Shell
npm install -g express-generator.
```
